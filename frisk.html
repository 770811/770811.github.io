        <p>Frisk is the main protagonist of undertale, and if you name yourself frisk, it will activate "hard mode", which is only as long as the first portion of the game. However, all the opponents are much harder, and some of them are from later in the game, but you do not have as good stuff to beat them, which makes it a lot harder. Later in the game, you find out that the name that you named your character is not actually the character themself, but the first human that ever fell to the underground. You cannot change the name of the character you play as, and you only find out that they are named when you do the true pacifist route, and Asriel asks if you really are (insert the name you entered here), and the next line is "What is your name?", which is followed by "Frisk, huh? That's a nice name".</p>
